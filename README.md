# Controlling Autonomous Mobility on Demand

This is a java project that uses graph theory to simulate an AMoD system, primarily controlled by the algorithm SCRAM.

## Getting Started

To install simply clone project. The three GraphStream libraries have to be installed; graph.core, graph.algo, graph.visual.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

We use JUnit for testing. The tests can be found in AmodSimulator/tests and can be run individually or collectively.
